## What is this

This is just a simple arcanoid implementation with small QoL features and a lil bit of polish (to not make it completely like the examples on the web).

I made it purely to:
1. Practice simple collision detection
2. Get a grip of macroquad
3. Implement something small and finished

## Controls

* Space -- start / reset on GameOver
* WASD/arrow keys -- control your paddle
* F11 -- toggle fullscreen
* Escape -- pause

## Building it yourself

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Rust and Cargo installed
2. Enter the project directory
3. Run `cargo build` there
